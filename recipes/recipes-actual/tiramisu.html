        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Tiramisu (Italian: tiramisù, [from tirami su, "pick me up" or "cheer me up")) 
                is a coffee-flavoured Italian dessert. It is made of ladyfingers (savoiardi)
                dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar, and mascarpone
                cheese, flavoured with cocoa. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties
                of cakes and other desserts. Its origins are often disputed among Italian
                regions Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
                <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 cup mascarpone (8 ounces)</li>
                <li>1 3/4 cups espresso</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons rum or cognac</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>~24 ladyfingers</li>
                <li>1 to 2 ounces chocolate for shaving</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Using an electric mixer in a medium bowl, whip together egg
                    yolks and ¼ cup sugar until very pale yellow and about tripled
                    in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or
                    whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Transfer 
                    mixture to a large bowl, wiping out the medium bowl used
                    to whip the yolks and set aside.</li>
                <li>In the medium bowl, whip cream and remaining ¼ cup sugar 
                    until it creates soft-medium peaks. Add mascarpone and 
                    continue to whip until it creates a soft, spreadable 
                    mixture with medium peaks. Gently fold the mascarpone
                     mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.</li>
                <li>Combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
                <li>Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish 
                    (an 8x8-inch dish, or a 9-inch round cake pan would also 
                    work here) with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder.</li>
                <li>Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into 
                    the espresso mixture -- they are quite porous and will 
                    fall apart if left in the liquid too long -- and place 
                    them rounded side up at the bottom of the baking dish. 
                    Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until you’ve got an
                    even layer, breaking the ladyfingers in half as needed
                    to fill in any obvious gaps (a little space in between
                    is O.K.). Spread half the mascarpone mixture onto the
                    ladyfingers in one even layer. Repeat with remaining
                    espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.</li>
                <li>Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder.
                     Top with shaved or finely grated chocolate, if desired.</li>
                <li>Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator 
                    for at least 4 hours (if you can wait 24 hours, all the 
                    better) before slicing or scooping to serve.</li>
            </ol>
